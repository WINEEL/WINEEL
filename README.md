# Wineel Wilson Dasari

MS CS at Santa Clara University. I build practical software across web, systems, and ML. I focus on reliability, security, and clear docs. Comfortable in C, C++, Java, Python, and modern web stacks. I like small tools that solve real problems and grow into useful products.


## Quick highlights

- NVIDIA Developer Hackathon: built an agentic **AI Career Coach** that parses resumes, critiques strengths and gaps with NVIDIA Nemotron on NIM, fetches live roles through MCP, and runs with one command on FastAPI. Functional demo in under 2 hours.
- **SmartRecs** hybrid movie recommender using IMDb datasets. TF-IDF content similarity plus SVD collaborative filtering with genre awareness.
- **QuickBill** and **MyCalc** in C. QuickBill handles CSV product management and billing. MyCalc behaves like a Python REPL with BODMAS, exponentiation, and nested parentheses.
- **GardenSim** in JavaFX applying OOADP with seasons, weather, pests, sensors, and survivability tests.


## Tech stack

**Programming:** Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Django, Flask, FastAPI, React, Flutter  
**Databases:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Firebase  
**Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub, Postman, Jupyter Notebook, VirtualBox  
**Concepts:** OOP, MVC, REST APIs, Authentication, Web API Design, Version Control, DSA, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Cryptography, Computer Networks, Database Systems, Web Technologies, Software Engineering


## Featured projects

- **[AI Career Coach](https://github.com/SCU-2025-Oct/coach)** &rarr; Agentic resume coach from the NVIDIA hackathon. Parses PDF and DOCX, generates measurable edits with Nemotron on NIM, fetches live roles via MCP, and serves a minimal FastAPI web UI. One command local run via `dev.py`.  

- **[SmartRecs](https://github.com/WINEEL/SmartRecs)** &rarr; Hybrid movie recommender on IMDb datasets. TF-IDF content similarity plus SVD collaborative filtering with genre awareness.  

- **[QuickBill](https://github.com/WINEEL/QuickBill)** &rarr; C billing system with admin and biller modules, CSV product management, GST and discounts, and cross platform Makefile.  

- **[MyCalc](https://github.com/WINEEL/MyCalc)** &rarr; C command line calculator that behaves like a Python REPL with BODMAS, exponentiation, and nested parentheses.  

- **[PIP-Updater](https://github.com/WINEEL/PIP-Updater)** &rarr; Python CLI that updates pip packages with clean logs.  

- **[GardenSim](https://github.com/WINEEL/GardenSim)** &rarr; JavaFX garden simulator applying OOADP with weather, seasons, pests, sensors, and survivability tests.
